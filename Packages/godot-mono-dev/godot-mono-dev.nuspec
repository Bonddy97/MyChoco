      ### Godot Engine

      #### 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine

      Godot Engine is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create 2D and
      3D games from a unified interface. It provides a comprehensive set of common
      tools, so that users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the
      wheel. Games can be exported in one click to a number of platforms, including
      the major desktop platforms (Linux, Mac OSX, Windows) as well as mobile
      (Android, iOS) and web-based (HTML5) platforms.

      #### Free, open source and community-driven

      Godot is completely free and open source under the very permissive MIT license.
      No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down
      to the last line of engine code. Godot's development is fully independent and
      community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their
      expectations. It is supported by the Software Freedom Conservancy
      not-for-profit.

      Before being open sourced in February 2014, Godot had been developed by Juan
      Linietsky and Ariel Manzur (both still maintaining the project) for several
      years as an in-house engine, used to publish several work-for-hire titles.
